  "brief": {
    "problem": "Most small CPG brands don’t fail because the product is bad—they stall because operations are chaotic: inconsistent forecasting, stockouts, bloated spend, slow reporting, and manual workflows. This idea is to buy “good product / bad ops” brands (Amazon-native or DTC) and apply a standardized AI ops layer that quickly improves visibility, predictability, and scalability.\n\nCore AI ops modules:\n\t•\tSingle source of truth: unify sales, ads, inventory, and finance into one dashboard with automated weekly reporting.\n\t•\tDemand + inventory forecasting: reorder points, cash planning, and stockout prevention (improve fill rates, reduce dead inventory).\n\t•\tMarketing ops automation: creative testing loops, budget pacing, attribution sanity checks, and margin-aware scaling.\n\t•\tCustomer support + voice of customer: automated triage, review mining, and product/positioning insights.\n\t•\tPlaybooks + integrations: templates, SOPs, and tooling that can be deployed in weeks—not months.\n\nWho it’s for: operators/investors acquiring $1–10M revenue CPG brands that have real demand but are inefficient. The differentiation is compounding: every acquisition strengthens the shared platform (data, workflows, vendor playbooks), making future turnarounds faster and cheaper.",
