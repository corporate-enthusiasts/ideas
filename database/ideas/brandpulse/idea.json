    "problem": "Description: Small businesses spend on SEO and ads but have zero visibility into what people are saying about them across review\n  sites, social media, Reddit, and forums. BrandPulse monitors mentions, classifies sentiment, flags urgent issues (bad reviews,\n  viral complaints), and sends a weekly digest. Andrew already has a paying SaaS doing LLM-based brand monitoring — this\n  productizes and scales it. Ben builds the AI pipeline and automation (scraping + LLM classification via n8n/Claude). Andrew\n  designs the UI and brings 40+ SMB clients as launch customers. Nick handles GTM and positioning against enterprise tools that are\n   10x the price. Launch at $49-99/mo per brand — SMBs already pay this for basic reputation tools that don't use AI.",
