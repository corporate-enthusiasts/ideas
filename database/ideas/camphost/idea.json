    "problem": "Small campgrounds and RV parks get hammered with the same 20 questions — check-in time, pet policy, firewood availability, WiFi password, local recommendations. Operators spend hours per day on repetitive guest messaging across email, text, and booking platforms.",
    "target_user": "Independent campground and RV park operators with 20-200 sites, especially mom-and-pop operations without dedicated front desk staff",
    "proposed_solution": "AI handles guest messaging across email/text/booking platforms — pre-arrival info, check-in instructions, local recommendations, FAQ answers, and post-stay review requests. Configured once with campground-specific info, then runs automatically.",

    "competition": { "score": 3, "reasoning": "CampVantage by Insider Perks exists at $99/mo but is early-stage. RoverPass added AI via Zapier. Legacy campground software (Campspot, RMS) doesn't have AI communication. Niche is nascent, not empty." },
    "team_fit": { "score": 4, "reasoning": "Nick has direct campground industry contacts providing warm distribution. Andrew's SMB/agency experience applies to onboarding. Ben builds the AI stack. Loses a point because nobody on the team has operated a campground." },

    "side_project_viability": { "score": 4, "reasoning": "MVP is a weekend build. Ongoing maintenance is light. Customer acquisition through Nick's contacts fits side-project pace. Only concern is onboarding — campground operators are low-tech." },
    "ai_leverage": { "score": 4, "reasoning": "AI is core — natural language understanding for varied guest questions, personalized responses, multi-channel handling. Would be impossible to automate without LLMs. Not just a wrapper." },
    "revenue_clarity": { "score": 4, "reasoning": "CampVantage validates willingness to pay at $99/mo. CampHost undercuts at $39-69/mo for price-sensitive mom-and-pop segment. Campground operators already pay for reservation software ($50-200/mo)." },
    "market_timing": { "score": 4, "reasoning": "Post-COVID outdoor recreation boom sustained — 32.8% participation increase, $61B spending. Younger, digitally-native campers expect faster communication. AI just became good enough for this." }

During peak season they spend 2-4 hours daily answering the same questions via email, phone, and booking platform messages.

  "summary": "CampHost is a STRONG idea that hits the sweet spot for the BotBoys team. It targets a specific, underserved niche (small campgrounds and RV parks) where technology adoption is low, competition is nascent, and the problem is real and repetitive. Nick's direct campground contacts provide a rare warm distribution channel that eliminates the typical SMB SaaS cold-start problem. The product is cheap to build, cheap to run, and largely passive once configured.\n\nTop 3 Strengths: (1) Nick's direct access to campground operators provides warm distribution in a niche that is hard to reach through traditional marketing. (2) Extremely cheap to build and operate — near-zero infrastructure costs with 96%+ gross margins. (3) Low competition in a specific niche where the incumbent (CampVantage) is early-stage and priced higher.\n\nTop 3 Concerns: (1) Technology adoption barrier — campground operators are notoriously low-tech and may resist AI guest communication. (2) Seasonal churn risk — campgrounds peak May-October, operators may cancel during off-season. (3) Revenue ceiling is lifestyle-business scale (~$600K-1.2M ARR at realistic penetration), not venture-scale.\n\nRecommended next steps: (1) Nick reaches out to 5-10 campground contacts for discovery calls. (2) Ben builds minimal MVP (email/text auto-responder) in 1-2 weekends. (3) Pilot with 2-3 of Nick's contacts free for 30 days before peak season (April). (4) Andrew designs dead-simple onboarding flow. (5) If pilot validates, launch paid product by May 2026.\n\nWho should lead: Nick Ost.",
