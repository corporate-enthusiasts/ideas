    "problem": "For someone who has things around the house they want to get rid of but doesn’t have the bandwidth to research the price, demand, and manage how it’s sold. The bot would take a photo and description from the user, then confirm how much they are selling for locally, confirm with the user how aggressively they’re trying to move the item, then posts it to their site of choice (fb marketplace, eBay, Poshmark, OfferUp, etc). Ideally it also handles back and forth with interested parties.",

  "verdict": "MEH",
  "summary": "This idea scores 49.74/100 (MEH) - it needs a significant pivot to be compelling for this team. The core problem is real and AI provides genuine leverage, but the business model fundamentally conflicts with the side-project constraint. Success requires being highly responsive to buyer inquiries within minutes/hours, managing pickup logistics, handling disputes over item condition, and providing white-glove customer service - none of which work at 4-8 hours per week with day jobs. The competition concern is also significant: marketplace giants have resources to build similar features in-house, and previous attempts at 'sell it for me' services have struggled with unit economics. The team has no unique advantages in the resale/marketplace space that would help them win against incumbents or justify why users would trust them with their belongings. The most viable pivot would be narrowing to a specific high-value vertical where the team has an edge (marine equipment in La Paz for Ben? corporate office furniture for Troy's network?) or shifting to a pure software play that helps people list items themselves faster, rather than doing it for them. As currently scoped, this requires either full-time commitment or a fundamentally different operational model.",
