  "brief": {
    "problem": "Launching a local CPG product is way harder than it looks—not because the product idea is complicated, but because the process is fragmented and high-friction: regulatory requirements, permits, compliant labeling, local sourcing, formulation, cost modeling, branding, packaging, distribution options, and launch planning. Most founders get stuck in research loops, vendor outreach, and paperwork before they ever ship a bottle.\n\nThis platform acts like a “co-founder in a box” powered by AI agents + workflows. It turns a user’s concept (e.g., a gin/vodka brand designed for weddings and private events, potentially served from a classic trailer) into a step-by-step execution plan, with documents, vendor lists, timelines, and decision support.\n\nKey workflows/agents:\n\t•\tRegulatory Navigator: generates a compliance checklist by location/category (permits, licensing, labeling constraints, recordkeeping), with a task plan and templates.\n\t•\tSourcing + Vendor Scout: finds and ranks local suppliers (ingredients, packaging, co-packers/distilleries), drafts outreach emails, and tracks responses.\n\t•\tUnit Economics Builder: builds a simple COGS + pricing model (batch sizes, packaging, taxes/fees, event-based pricing).\n\t•\tBrand + Packaging Studio: produces positioning, naming directions, label copy, and packaging requirements aligned to compliance.\n\t•\tLaunch Planner: creates a local GTM plan—events, partnerships, sampling strategy, distribution path, and a week-by-week checklist.\n\nBusiness model: subscription for the platform + optional paid add-ons (done-with-you setup, vendor introductions, label/brand packages, compliance review partners). Start with spirits as the wedge, then expand into other local CPG categories (coffee, sauces, wellness, etc.).",

      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "Fragmented competition—legal/compliance SaaS exists (LegalZoom, Harbor Compliance), consulting exists, but no integrated AI-first platform for end-to-end CPG launch. Room for differentiation but not a blue ocean."

    "bootstrappability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "Can build a lean MVP with AI agents and workflow automation, but needs domain research (regulatory data, vendor databases, compliance templates) and content creation upfront. Likely $500-2K and 4-8 weeks to ship something useful."

    "passive_potential": {
      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "Platform requires ongoing content updates (regulations change, vendor lists go stale, compliance rules vary by state/locale). Customer support will be high-touch—users need hand-holding through complex processes."

    "side_project_viability": {
      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "Building the initial agent workflows is doable at side-project pace, but maintaining regulatory accuracy, curating vendor databases, and supporting users through compliance is resource-intensive and risky at 4-8 hrs/week."

    "revenue_clarity": {
      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "Clear B2C SaaS subscription model with upsell opportunities (done-with-you services, vendor intros, compliance reviews). Target users (aspiring CPG founders) have demonstrated willingness to pay for speed and de-risking."

      "score": 3,

  "composite_score": 67,
  "verdict": "PROMISING",
  "summary": "This is a PROMISING idea with clear strengths but meaningful execution risks. The team has exceptional fit—Nick's CPG operations and supply chain background, Andrew's SMB/brand expertise, and Ben's ability to build AI agent platforms make this one of the strongest team-idea matches in the portfolio. The product vision is compelling: turning a fragmented, intimidating process into a guided, AI-powered workflow that saves aspiring founders months of research and costly missteps. Revenue model is solid, and AI leverage is real—this would be nearly impossible to build without LLMs. The core concern is passive potential and side-project viability. Regulatory compliance is high-stakes (errors = legal liability), data goes stale quickly (permits, vendors, rules change), and users will need significant hand-holding. Maintaining accuracy and trust at 4-8 hrs/week per person is a major risk. This could easily become a high-touch consulting business disguised as software. Recommended next steps: (1) validate demand with a no-code concierge MVP—manually guide 3-5 founders through spirits launch and see if they'd pay $500-2K for the service, (2) assess regulatory data maintenance burden (can you automate updates or partner with compliance providers?), and (3) explore a narrower wedge (one state, one category) to reduce scope and test if the workflows can truly be passive. If you can prove the concept works with minimal ongoing effort, this could scale. If not, pivot to a premium done-with-you service or pass.",
