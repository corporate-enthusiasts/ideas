    "problem": "AI is bringing massive changes to how people search and find businesses. Business owners are aware that managing their online presence is important but don't know where to start. We build a sophisticated tool that not only monitors classic SEO performance and LLM mentions but also actively monitors changes in the digital landscape that are localized and indutry specific (like which 3rd party platforms are weighed favroably). It also monitors reviews. Basically a modern version of Birdeye but AI first. Combine Andrew's digital marketing chops, with Nick's network, Ben's coding abilities. This goes beyond the existing digital visibility tool Andrew and Nick have running to provide the heartbeat report and action item list -- maybe complete with automated notifications - to keep an owner or marketing director aware and in control of online presence",

    "team_fit": {
      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "Strong fit with Andrew's 9 years managing SMB digital marketing clients, Nick's GTM/fundraising experience, and Ben's AI automation abilities. Andrew already has a paying LLM monitoring product proving concept validation."

    "bootstrappability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "Initial MVP is buildable with API costs for monitoring (OpenAI, Perplexity, review APIs) but ongoing scraping/monitoring infrastructure could get expensive at scale. Likely $500-2K to launch properly with reliable monitoring."
    },
    "passive_potential": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "Automated monitoring and alerts can run passively, but SMB customers will need support, onboarding help, and custom recommendations. Customer success requirements prevent true set-and-forget operation."

    "side_project_viability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "Core monitoring tech is buildable at side-project pace, but competing with well-funded players means constant feature iteration. Customer support and sales to SMBs will consume hours beyond initial build."

    "ai_leverage": {
      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "AI is central to the differentiation - LLM monitoring, intelligent recommendations, and automated change detection are impossible without AI. Goes beyond bolt-on to being core product value."

    "revenue_clarity": {
      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "SMBs already pay $100-500/month for reputation management tools like Birdeye. Andrew has a paying customer proving willingness to pay for LLM monitoring specifically."

    "market_timing": {
      "score": 5,
      "reasoning": "Perfect timing as AI search fundamentally disrupts SEO and businesses are panicking about LLM visibility. Technology just enabled this use case and demand is spiking as ChatGPT search and Perplexity gain adoption."

  "summary": "ReputAItion targets a growing pain point at the perfect moment - businesses scrambling to understand AI search visibility - but faces significant competitive headwinds. The team fit is excellent with Andrew's proven SMB marketing expertise and existing paying product, Nick's GTM capabilities, and Ben's automation skills. The AI-first approach and timing are genuinely strong advantages. However, this space is rapidly commoditizing as every SEO and reputation tool adds LLM monitoring. The core concern is differentiation: what makes this defensible against Birdeye adding AI features or venture-backed startups outspending you on sales and marketing?\n\nThe idea scores 68/100 (PROMISING) with clear strengths in team fit, timing, and revenue clarity, but weakness in competition. The SMB customer segment requires meaningful hand-holding and sales effort that conflicts with passive income goals. Andrew's existing paying customer is valuable validation but not sufficient moat.\n\nRecommended next steps: (1) Interview Andrew's current customer and 10-15 SMB owners to validate if they'd pay premium over Birdeye for better AI monitoring, (2) Define the specific wedge - what's the one thing you'll do 10x better that incumbents can't easily copy? (local AI search? specific verticals? automated action-taking vs just monitoring?), (3) Build lightweight MVP expanding Andrew's tool with automated monitoring and test with 5 paying pilot customers before committing. Without a clear differentiation wedge beyond 'Birdeye but AI-first,' this becomes a sales execution game you'll lose to funded players.",
