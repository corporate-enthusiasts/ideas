    "problem": "AI is bringing massive changes to how people search and find businesses. Business owners are aware that managing their online presence is important but don't know where to start. We build a sophisticated tool that not only monitors classic SEO performance and LLM mentions but also actively monitors changes in the digital landscape that are localized and indutry specific (like which 3rd party platforms are weighed favroably). It also monitors reviews. Basically a modern version of Birdeye but AI first. Combine Andrew's digital marketing chops, with Nick's network, Ben's coding abilities. This goes beyond the existing digital visibility tool Andrew and Nick have running to provide the heartbeat report and action item list -- maybe complete with automated notifications - to keep an owner or marketing director aware and in control of online presence",

    "competition": {
      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "Market is extremely crowded with well-funded incumbents (Birdeye, BrightLocal, Yext) plus every major SEO tool adding LLM monitoring. Late entrants face significant brand recognition and distribution challenges against players with established SMB sales channels."
    },
    "team_fit": {
      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "Andrew's 9 years managing 40+ SMB clients gives deep customer insight, and he already has a paying customer for LLM monitoring proving product-market fit. Ben's AI automation skills and Nick's GTM experience create a strong execution trio for this exact use case."
    },
    "bootstrappability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "API costs for continuous monitoring (LLM queries, review scraping, search tracking) will add up quickly across multiple customers. Infrastructure for reliable 24/7 monitoring and alert systems requires more than weekend MVP—likely $1-2K+ and several weeks to launch properly."
    },
    "passive_potential": {
      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "SMBs buying this product expect hand-holding, custom recommendations, and reactive support when their reputation issues arise. The monitoring can run automatically, but customer success, onboarding, and explaining complex AI insights will require significant ongoing human involvement."
    },
    "side_project_viability": {
      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "Competing against funded companies means constant feature development to keep pace, plus SMB sales cycles require persistent outreach and demos. Customer support requests and technical maintenance will quickly exceed 8 hrs/week once you have 10+ paying customers."
    },
    "ai_leverage": {
      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "AI is core to the differentiation—LLM mention tracking, intelligent change detection, and automated recommendations are impossible without AI. This goes beyond bolt-on features to being the primary value proposition that distinguishes from legacy SEO tools."
    },
    "revenue_clarity": {
      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "Andrew already has a paying customer proving willingness to pay, and the SMB reputation management market has established pricing ($100-500/month). Clear path from free trial to paid conversion with demonstrable ROI through visibility metrics."
    },
    "market_timing": {
      "score": 5,
      "reasoning": "Perfect timing as ChatGPT search, Perplexity, and AI overviews fundamentally disrupt traditional SEO, creating urgent demand for LLM visibility monitoring. Technology enabling this just became accessible and SMBs are actively seeking solutions to understand their AI search presence."

  "summary": "ReputAItion targets a growing, urgent need but faces a fundamental strategic challenge: you're entering a crowded market where well-funded incumbents are rapidly adding the exact AI features you're building. While Andrew's existing paying customer and deep SMB expertise provide validation, the team's side-project constraints clash with the reality of competing against companies with dedicated sales teams, established brand trust, and 24/7 support infrastructure. SMBs are notoriously high-touch customers who expect hand-holding, making this difficult to run passively alongside day jobs.\n\nThe strongest argument for building this is market timing—the AI search disruption is real and urgent, and Andrew already has proof of concept with a paying customer. The team has genuine advantages: Andrew's 9-year track record managing SMB digital marketing gives authentic customer insight, Ben can build sophisticated monitoring infrastructure, and Nick can execute GTM. However, the path from side project to sustainable business requires either accepting limited growth (staying small and focused) or eventually needing full-time commitment to compete.\n\nRecommended next steps: Before building a full platform, validate whether you can win a specific niche that incumbents are ignoring. Interview Andrew's existing customer and 10 more SMBs to find a narrow vertical (e.g., multi-location healthcare, local legal firms) where you have unique insight or distribution advantage. If you can't identify a wedge market where you're 10x better for a specific persona, this becomes a features arms race you'll lose to funded competitors. Consider pivoting to white-label AI monitoring infrastructure for agencies rather than competing directly for SMB customers.",
