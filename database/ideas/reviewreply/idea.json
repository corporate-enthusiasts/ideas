  "summary": "ReviewReply scores 81/100 STRONG and represents a highly buildable, fast-to-market SMB tool with an exceptional distribution advantage through Andrew's agency client base. The team fit is the best possible configuration: Andrew owns the problem space, has 40+ warm leads, and can validate in days rather than weeks. The product is trivially cheap to build and operate, with 97%+ gross margins and a clear path to first dollar within a month.\n\nTop 3 Strengths: (1) Unmatched distribution — Andrew's 40+ agency clients create a zero-CAC launch pipeline. (2) Extreme buildability — MVP can ship in 1-2 weekends. (3) BrandPulse synergy — natural upsell/bundle that creates switching costs.\n\nTop 3 Concerns: (1) Crowded, commoditizing market — Resolva exists at exact same price point, Google may add native AI responses. (2) Low revenue ceiling standalone — $19-29/mo with SMB churn is a treadmill. (3) Yelp integration risk — API restrictions limit to Google-only initially.\n\nRecommended next steps: (1) Andrew pitches 5 agency clients this week to validate. (2) Ben builds Chrome extension MVP. (3) Position as BrandPulse add-on from day one. (4) If 5+ clients commit, build full automated pipeline.\n\nWho should lead: Andrew Herzog.",
