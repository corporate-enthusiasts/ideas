    "competition": { "score": 3, "reasoning": "15+ established vendors (Dockwa with 2,000+ marinas, Molo, HarbaMaster with free tier, MarinaOffice). Small marina niche is underserved but not empty." },
    "team_fit": { "score": 4, "reasoning": "Ben's La Paz move provides embedded, trust-based distribution that no remote competitor can replicate. Boating network provides warm intros. But Ben is not a marina operator; team lacks marina domain depth." },

Enterprise marina software exists but costs $250-500+/mo and is designed for 500+ slip operations. Small marinas can't justify the cost and are stuck with manual processes that lead to double-bookings, missed maintenance, and lost revenue from transient boaters they can't efficiently accommodate.",

Ceiling is modest because small marina market is limited and requires relationship-based sales." }
  },
  "summary": "SlipStream is a PROMISING idea with a clear niche, affordable price point, and a genuine unfair advantage in Ben's upcoming relocation to La Paz. The marina management software market is established with 15+ competitors, but most target medium-to-large operations at $250-500+/mo, leaving small marinas underserved. The product itself is technically straightforward and cheap to build and operate.\n\nTop 3 Strengths: (1) Ben physically moving to La Paz provides embedded, trust-based distribution that no remote competitor can replicate. (2) Natural ecosystem synergy with BoatStash — B2B SlipStream + B2C BoatStash creates a two-sided boating platform. (3) Extremely low cost to build and operate with proven B2B SaaS model at $50-100/mo, well below alternatives.\n\nTop 3 Concerns: (1) Established competition (Dockwa has 2,000+ marinas, HarbaMaster offers free tier) in a mature market with no technological inflection point. (2) High-touch, relationship-based sales required for change-resistant marina operators — difficult to scale at side-project pace beyond Ben's personal network. (3) Revenue ceiling is modest ($90K-180K ARR at realistic scale) — good side income but limited upside.\n\nRecommended next steps: (1) Build BoatStash first — it's higher scoring and validates the community. (2) Build bare-bones SlipStream MVP by July 2026 before the La Paz move. (3) Upon arrival in La Paz (Aug 2026), demo to 5 marina operators. (4) If 2+ marinas commit as paying beta users, pursue; if not, focus on BoatStash.\n\nWho should lead: Ben Battles.",
